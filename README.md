# Design Thinking II
For our Elements Of Computer Programming II class @ Delaware State University in Spring 2019, we had to act as a starfleet command and send a robot to a specific location without directly controlling it. We had to find the moob (the object we're finding), retrieve it and escape the maze within 15 minutes

The requirements to the project went as such:
- The communication had to be autonomous to the robot
    - Meaning that you can't control the robot (SSH, VNC Viewer)
- You can only send and recieve 5 commands
- Must be able to traverse through a maze
- Be able to identify an object
    - Determine if it's movable, immovable, if it's the sample or the moob

We were given an Camera to take pictures to determine what we believe each of the objects were. Our way of communication was a website that would be able to send text commands to the website and recieve images when they come in.

This Project was completed by: **Justin Bennett** (*Freshman*), **Paola Camacho** (*Freshman*), **Jessica Nguiyim** (*Sophomore*), **Humberto (Alex) Trejo Galvan** (*Freshman*), and **Kishaye Williams** (*Freshman*)
