# Design Thinking II
For our Elements Of Computer Programming II class @ Delaware State University, we had to act as a starfleet command and send a robot to a specific location without directly controlling it.

The requirements to the project went as such:
     - The communication had to be autonomous to the robot
          - Meaning that we can't just keep telling the robot where to go at all times (No SSH, VNC Viewer etc.)
